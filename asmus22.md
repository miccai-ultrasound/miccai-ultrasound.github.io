**The 3rd International Workshop of Advances in Simplifying Medical UltraSound (ASMUS) - a workshop held in conjunction with [MICCAI 2022](https://conferences.miccai.org/2022/), the 25th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention.**

**ASMUS is the offical workshop of the [MICCAI Special Interest Group on Medical Ultrasound](home).**

## Call for Papers

Papers will consist of maximum 8 pages (text, figures and tables) + up to 2 pages for references only. They are to be submitted electronically in [Springer LNCS (Lecture Notes in Computer Science) style](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines) and are subject to double blind review. Information on submission to follow.

The papers will be evaluated by external reviewers and our organizing committee for inclusion in the workshop as a presentation (oral or poster). Accepted full-length manuscripts will be published with Springer LNCS and the best papers will be selected for industry-sponsored awards. Original research contributions are invited. Proof-of-concept research from novel research directions is also encouraged.

One of the popular features of ASMUS, live demonstrations, will return for ASMUS 2022. Capitalising on the unique real-time and portability aspects of ultrasound-based applications, we plan for live demonstrations covering AI, interventional and robotics areas. All accepted papers will be offered the option to present a live demonstration.
