**The 3rd International Workshop of Advances in Simplifying Medical UltraSound (ASMUS) - a workshop held in conjunction with [MICCAI 2022](https://conferences.miccai.org/2022/), the 25th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention.**

**ASMUS is the offical workshop of the [MICCAI Special Interest Group on Medical Ultrasound](home).**

> The submission portal is now available at [Springer Nature EquinOCS](https://equinocs.springernature.com/home). *E-Mail registration required prior to submission*.

## Call for Papers

Papers will consist of maximum 8 pages (text, figures and tables) + up to 2 pages for references only. They are to be submitted electronically in [Springer LNCS (Lecture Notes in Computer Science) style](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines) and are subject to double blind review. Information on submission to follow.

The papers will be evaluated by external reviewers and our organizing committee for inclusion in the workshop as a presentation (oral or poster). Accepted full-length manuscripts will be published with Springer LNCS and the best papers will be selected for industry-sponsored awards. Original research contributions are invited. Proof-of-concept research from novel research directions is also encouraged.

One of the popular features of ASMUS, live demonstrations, will return for ASMUS 2022. Capitalising on the unique real-time and portability aspects of ultrasound-based applications, we plan for live demonstrations covering AI, interventional and robotics areas. All accepted papers will be offered the option to present a live demonstration.

You may start the submission process at [Springer Nature EquinOCS](https://equinocs.springernature.com/home). E-Mail registration required prior to submission, which can be accessed by clicking the "REGISTER NOW" button on the previous link. If you have any issues registering or with the submission process, please contact the PC Chairs via the platform or via E-Mail.
