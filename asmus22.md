**The 3rd International Workshop of Advances in Simplifying Medical UltraSound (ASMUS) - a workshop held in conjunction with [MICCAI 2022](https://conferences.miccai.org/2022/), the 25th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention.**

**ASMUS is the offical workshop of the [MICCAI Special Interest Group on Medical Ultrasound](home).**

> The submission portal is now available at [Springer Nature EquinOCS](https://equinocs.springernature.com/home). *E-Mail registration required prior to submission*.

> The submission deadline has been extended to June 27 2022 - Please see the below Workshop Timeline for complete details.

## Call for Papers

Papers will consist of maximum 8 pages (text, figures and tables) + up to 2 pages for references only. They are to be submitted electronically in [Springer LNCS (Lecture Notes in Computer Science) style](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines) and are subject to double blind review. Information on submission to follow.

The papers will be evaluated by external reviewers and our organizing committee for inclusion in the workshop as a presentation (oral or poster). Accepted full-length manuscripts will be published with Springer LNCS and the best papers will be selected for industry-sponsored awards. Original research contributions are invited. Proof-of-concept research from novel research directions is also encouraged.

One of the popular features of ASMUS, live demonstrations, will return for ASMUS 2022. Capitalising on the unique real-time and portability aspects of ultrasound-based applications, we plan for live demonstrations covering AI, interventional and robotics areas. All accepted papers will be offered the option to present a live demonstration.

You may start the submission process at [Springer Nature EquinOCS](https://equinocs.springernature.com/home). E-Mail registration required prior to submission, which can be accessed by clicking the "REGISTER NOW" button on the previous link. If you have any issues registering or with the submission process, please contact the PC Chairs via the platform or via E-Mail.

## Program

**The full day ASMUS workshop will take place on September 18th 2022, and include live practical technology demonstrations, paper presentations, Q&A sessions, and keynote talks.**

This year's ASMUS will feature [keynotes](#keynote-speakers), 3 live demonstrations, and nearly 20 presentations on cutting edge research from international academics and industry leaders.

ASMUS 2022 aims to provide an intellectually stimulating forum to bring together the international MICCAI research community working towards the next generation of medical ultrasound imaging methods, systems and practices. 

In this exciting era for medical ultrasound, recent developments in deep learning (artificial intelligence) and medical robotics have started to show clinically measurable improvement in assisting ultrasound examinations, ultrasound-guided interventions and surgery. This year, ASMUS is soliciting submissions, including work from the following areas:

### Ultrasound Assisted by Artificial Intelligence and Medical Robotics:
- Ultrasound imaging with robotic (automated) assistance
- Machine learning methods in ultrasound analysis and guidance
- Automated interpretation and measurement for ultrasound
- Ultrasound quality and skills assessment

### Multimodality Ultrasound Imaging:
- Ultrasound with other non-imaging sensory information, e.g. positional and eye tracking
- Ultrasound with another pre-/intra-procedural imaging, e.g. camera videos, CT, MR, fluorescence
- Different modes of ultrasound imaging, e.g. photoacoustic, Doppler, functional ultrasound, tissue quantification

### Applications:
- Global healthcare
- Training sonographers and other users
- Assisting non-expert healthcare professionals
- Point-of-care ultrasound systems and scenarios
- Assisting surgery and interventions
- Streamlining clinical ultrasound workflow
- Sonography data science

#### *Quantitative lung ultrasound: finding new sources of contrast to detect and quantify lung diseases*

Marie Muller is an Associate Professor in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at North Carolina State University. She received her B.S. in Physics from the Pierre et Marie Curie University in Paris, France in 2002, and her Ph.D in Physical Acoustics from the University of Paris, France in 2006. After a postdoctorate at the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, she returned to Paris, as an Assistant Professor with the Institut Langevin. In 2014, she moved to North Carolina and joined the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering department at NCSU. She is also an associate Faculty with the Joint Department of Biomedical Engineering at UNC and NCSU.  

Dr. Muller has pioneered the use of ultrasound multiple scattering to characterize the lung. Her work has been recognized with several awards, including the prestigious Galien Medstartup Award in 2020, in collaboration with E-scopics, the ICU Early Career Award, the Young Investigator Award from the French Society of Acoustics, the PhD thesis award from the French Society of Biological and Medical Engineering and IEEE France Section, the Prize for a Young Parisian female researcher from the City of Paris, and the Stephens award at the International Congress of Ultrasonics. She is a member of IEEE, the Acoustical Society of America, and of the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine. She is also a founding member and member of the board of the International Bone Ultrasound Society.

Conventional ultrasound is unsuitable for imaging lung tissue due to the presence of air-filled alveoli, responsible for significant amounts of scattering of ultrasound waves. As a results, conventional ultrasound images of lung tissue are not a visual representation of lung tissue. They are however of some clinical interest, because diseased lungs exhibit typical vertical artifacts on ultrasound images, called B-lines. These B-lines have significant limitation. They are not specific, system-dependent and qualitative. It is therefore necessary to define new source of contrast that would enable the detection and quantification of lung diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary edema, ARDS, etc.. with good specificity. 

We propose to take advantage of ultrasound scattering in lungs, by using it a source of contrast to characterize lung tissue. Healthy lungs are expected to be responsible for larger amounts of scattering than diseased lungs, due to the presence of healthy, air-filled alveoli. In addition, the spatial distribution of alveoli has an impact on scattering patterns. Based on these principles, we demonstrate that it is possible to use ultrasound scattering as a source of contrast to detect and assess the severity of pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary edema. We also show that it is possible to detect and localize pulmonary nodules in real time, in order to guide nodule resection during thoracic surgery.
