#### *Quantitative lung ultrasound: finding new sources of contrast to detect and quantify lung diseases*

Marie Muller is an Associate Professor in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at North Carolina State University. She received her B.S. in Physics from the Pierre et Marie Curie University in Paris, France in 2002, and her Ph.D in Physical Acoustics from the University of Paris, France in 2006. After a postdoctorate at the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, she returned to Paris, as an Assistant Professor with the Institut Langevin. In 2014, she moved to North Carolina and joined the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering department at NCSU. She is also an associate Faculty with the Joint Department of Biomedical Engineering at UNC and NCSU.  

Dr. Muller has pioneered the use of ultrasound multiple scattering to characterize the lung. Her work has been recognized with several awards, including the prestigious Galien Medstartup Award in 2020, in collaboration with E-scopics, the ICU Early Career Award, the Young Investigator Award from the French Society of Acoustics, the PhD thesis award from the French Society of Biological and Medical Engineering and IEEE France Section, the Prize for a Young Parisian female researcher from the City of Paris, and the Stephens award at the International Congress of Ultrasonics. She is a member of IEEE, the Acoustical Society of America, and of the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine. She is also a founding member and member of the board of the International Bone Ultrasound Society.

Conventional ultrasound is unsuitable for imaging lung tissue due to the presence of air-filled alveoli, responsible for significant amounts of scattering of ultrasound waves. As a results, conventional ultrasound images of lung tissue are not a visual representation of lung tissue. They are however of some clinical interest, because diseased lungs exhibit typical vertical artifacts on ultrasound images, called B-lines. These B-lines have significant limitation. They are not specific, system-dependent and qualitative. It is therefore necessary to define new source of contrast that would enable the detection and quantification of lung diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary edema, ARDS, etc.. with good specificity. 

We propose to take advantage of ultrasound scattering in lungs, by using it a source of contrast to characterize lung tissue. Healthy lungs are expected to be responsible for larger amounts of scattering than diseased lungs, due to the presence of healthy, air-filled alveoli. In addition, the spatial distribution of alveoli has an impact on scattering patterns. Based on these principles, we demonstrate that it is possible to use ultrasound scattering as a source of contrast to detect and assess the severity of pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary edema. We also show that it is possible to detect and localize pulmonary nodules in real time, in order to guide nodule resection during thoracic surgery. 

### Dr Ryan Gessner, PhD

#### Co-Founder and General Manager, SonoVol (a PerkinElmer Company)

#### *From a graduate student’s idea to a globally deployed instrument: the decade-long journey to democratize the power of ultrasound by creating a robotic imaging scanner for preclinical research*

Ryan Gessner is the General Manager of the PerkinElmer-SonoVol site in Durham, North Carolina. In 2008 he received his B.S. in Physics from the Acadia University in Nova Scotia Canada, and in 2013 his Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering from the Joint Department of Biomedical Engineering at UNC Chapel Hill and NC State University. In collaboration with his Ph.D. advisor, Dr. Paul Dayton, while he was a graduate student he co-founded a company “SonoVol” (Sono = ultrasound, Vol = 3D volumetric tools) as a channel for commercializing the imaging technologies they had developed in the lab. After his graduation from UNC, Ryan had not yet secured funding for their venture, so he joined the ranks of a local biomedical imaging company in Research Triangle Park: Bioptigen. Prior to its eventual acquisition by Leica Microsystems, Bioptigen offered optical coherence tomography (OCT) products for both preclinical research as well as clinical applications. While there, Ryan observed a trend that most biologically-minded customers (as opposed to engineering customers) didn’t have the computational or analytical expertise to efficiently get quantitative values from their high resolution 3D image data. This led him to support several customers by building custom image analysis tools for their research applications. This realization was foundational during the next chapter of his career.

While working at Bioptigen, Ryan spent his free time on nights and weekends writing research grant proposals to fund the initial prototypes for a commercially deployable 3D ultrasound imaging system. In 2014 SonoVol received their first small business research grant from the National Science Foundation. With this funding, they built an early prototype of what would years later become the Vega imaging system: a high throughput automated scanner for robotic ultrasound imaging. Over the subsequent years, the team steadily grew from 1 to 10 engineers, and continued to support their development efforts through small business innovation research projects (SBIR grants) with collaborations across the country, as well as commercial sales of the instrument. In 2022, the company merged with PerkinElmer (press release link), a global leader in life science tools across many different disease research and drug development application areas. Ryan still oversees operations at their headquarters in Research Triangle Park, as the team supports ongoing R&D efforts for the Vega product and PerkinElmer scales this technology across the globe.

In this talk, Ryan will discuss what it was like to form a startup company based on university licensed intellectual property, develop imaging-based technologies involving both hardware and software components (with the biologist end user in mind), and provide an overview of specific design challenges for their robotic imaging system than addresses a wide array of needs by their customers in the market.
