**The 3rd International Workshop of Advances in Simplifying Medical UltraSound (ASMUS) - a workshop held in conjunction with [MICCAI 2022](https://conferences.miccai.org/2022/), the 25th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention.**

**ASMUS is the offical workshop of the [MICCAI Special Interest Group on Medical Ultrasound](home).**

> The submission portal is now available at [Springer Nature EquinOCS](https://equinocs.springernature.com/home). *E-Mail registration required prior to submission*.

> The submission deadline has been extended to June 27 2022 - Please see the below Workshop Timeline for complete details.

## Call for Papers

Papers will consist of maximum 8 pages (text, figures and tables) + up to 2 pages for references only. They are to be submitted electronically in [Springer LNCS (Lecture Notes in Computer Science) style](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines) and are subject to double blind review. Information on submission to follow.

The papers will be evaluated by external reviewers and our organizing committee for inclusion in the workshop as a presentation (oral or poster). Accepted full-length manuscripts will be published with Springer LNCS and the best papers will be selected for industry-sponsored awards. Original research contributions are invited. Proof-of-concept research from novel research directions is also encouraged.

One of the popular features of ASMUS, live demonstrations, will return for ASMUS 2022. Capitalising on the unique real-time and portability aspects of ultrasound-based applications, we plan for live demonstrations covering AI, interventional and robotics areas. All accepted papers will be offered the option to present a live demonstration.

You may start the submission process at [Springer Nature EquinOCS](https://equinocs.springernature.com/home). E-Mail registration required prior to submission, which can be accessed by clicking the "REGISTER NOW" button on the previous link. If you have any issues registering or with the submission process, please contact the PC Chairs via the platform or via E-Mail.

ASMUS 2022 aims to provide an intellectually stimulating forum to bring together the international MICCAI research community working towards the next generation of medical ultrasound imaging methods, systems and practices. 

In this exciting era for medical ultrasound, recent developments in deep learning (artificial intelligence) and medical robotics have started to show clinically measurable improvement in assisting ultrasound examinations, ultrasound-guided interventions and surgery. This year, ASMUS is soliciting submissions, including work from the following areas:

### Ultrasound Assisted by Artificial Intelligence and Medical Robotics:
- Ultrasound imaging with robotic (automated) assistance
- Machine learning methods in ultrasound analysis and guidance
- Automated interpretation and measurement for ultrasound
- Ultrasound quality and skills assessment

### Multimodality Ultrasound Imaging:
- Ultrasound with other non-imaging sensory information, e.g. positional and eye tracking
- Ultrasound with another pre-/intra-procedural imaging, e.g. camera videos, CT, MR, fluorescence
- Different modes of ultrasound imaging, e.g. photoacoustic, Doppler, functional ultrasound, tissue quantification

### Applications:
- Global healthcare
- Training sonographers and other users
- Assisting non-expert healthcare professionals
- Point-of-care ultrasound systems and scenarios
- Assisting surgery and interventions
- Streamlining clinical ultrasound workflow
- Sonography data science
