# The MICCAI Ultrasound SIG

The MICCAI Ultrasound SIG aims to bring together the MICCAI research community working towards the next generation of medical ultrasound imaging methods and systems. 

We envisage a future for clinical ultrasound that truly combines advances both in medical image computing (MIC) and computer-assisted intervention (CAI), acknowledging the unique imaging modality operated directly by human operators, or in the future, robotic systems. 

As a research community, we will design and implement new ultrasound-enabled applications to provide revolutionary healthcare benefits.   

The MICCAI Ultrasound SIG is the product of three highly successful MICCAI workshops in 2017, 2018, and 2020; establishing the SIG as a permanent basis throughout the year for bringing together the rapidly expanding number of communities in ultrasound imaging, ultrasound image computing, point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS), surgical and interventional ultrasound guidance, and robotic ultrasound.
