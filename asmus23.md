> **The ASMUS Workshop will be held on October 8th at 8 a.m. in Meeting Room 8 at Level 1. You can also [join virtually](https://miccai2023.conflux.events/app/schedule/session/3317). See you there!**

**The 4th International Workshop of Advances in Simplifying Medical UltraSound (ASMUS) - a workshop held in conjunction with [MICCAI 2023](https://conferences.miccai.org/2023/), the 26th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention.**

**ASMUS is the official workshop of the [MICCAI Special Interest Group on Medical Ultrasound](home).**

> **The workshop proceedings will be published before the conference starts [https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-44521-7](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-44521-7). Workshop attendees can access the proceedings until the four weeks after the conference.**

## Call for Papers

Papers will consist of a maximum 8 pages (text, figures, and tables) + up to 2 pages for references only. They are to be submitted electronically in [Springer LNCS (Lecture Notes in Computer Science) style](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines) and are subject to double-blind review. Information on submission to follow.

The papers will be evaluated by external reviewers and our organizing committee for inclusion in the workshop as a presentation (oral or poster). Accepted full-length manuscripts will be published with Springer LNCS, and the best papers will be selected for industry-sponsored awards. Original research contributions are invited. Proof-of-concept research from novel research directions is also encouraged.

One of the popular features of ASMUS, live demonstrations, will return for ASMUS 2023. Capitalising on the unique real-time and portability aspects of ultrasound-based applications, we plan for live demonstrations covering AI, interventional, and robotics areas. All accepted papers will be offered the option to present a live demonstration.

You may start the submission process at [Springer Nature EquinOCS](https://equinocs.springernature.com/service/ASMUS2023). E-mail registration is required prior to submission, which can be accessed by clicking the "Submit now" button on the previous link. If you have any issues registering or with the submission process, please contact the PC Chairs via the platform or via E-Mail.

## Keynote Speaker

### Prof. Mirabela Rusu

_Title:_ Artificial intelligence methods for b-mode ultrasound of the prostate to guide the biopsy procedure: Are we there yet?

_Abstract:_ Despite the advancements in prostate MRI, most prostate biopsies are still performed under the guidance of ultrasound alone. These procedures are imperfect, missing >50% of clinically significant cancers. By comparison, when MRI is utilized in an MRI-Ultrasound guided biopsy, the procedure only misses 12% of cancers. My team’s research has been focusing on using the ubiquitous but noisy b-mode ultrasound images to detect and localize prostate cancer, in approaches that often rely on MRI during the training of the models, but only use b-mode ultrasound images at inference time in new patients. Improving the ability of ultrasound to better show cancer has potential to enable early cancer detection, sparing men of biopsies when they are not needed, and allow for better targeting during local treatment.

_Bio:_ Dr. Mirabela Rusu received her MS and PhD in Computational Biomedicine from University of Texas, Houston, and focused her research on the fusion of biomolecular structural data from different sources (i.e., cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography). Her postdoctoral training at Rutgers and Case Western Reserve University was focused on developing computational methods for the fusion of medical images, i.e., to register radiology or pathology images, or create population atlases for prostate cancer studies. Following postdoctoral training, Dr. Rusu joined Industry as an Image Analysis Scientist/Lead Engineer. Currently, Dr. Rusu is an Assistant Professor of Radiology, and by courtesy, Urology and Data Science, at Stanford University, where she leads the Personalized Integrative Medicine Laboratory (http://pimed.stanford.edu). Dr. Rusu’s team focuses on developing analytic methods to improve the interpretation of radiology images by taking advantage of existing high-resolution information during training but only needing lower-resolution radiology images during inference (e.g., when applied in new patients).

## Challenge

### [µ-RegPro Challenge](https://muregpro.github.io/)

Multimodal image registration between pre-operative and intra-operative imaging enables the fusion of clinically important information during many surgical and interventional tasks. The registration of magnetic resonance imaging (MR) and transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) images assists prostate biopsy and focal therapy, arguably having transformed prostate cancer patient care to a less invasive and more localized diagnostic, monitoring and treatment pathway. Though, even with great progress having been made by the community in the past two decades, challenges remain in this application.
The µ-RegPro challenge aims to provide well-curated, yet real-world clinical data, with more than a hundred paired MR and TRUS images, annotated carefully by researchers and clinicians with more than 15 years of experience working with this application. The outcome of the challenge includes one of the first multimodal imaging datasets, facilitated with expert annotations for validation, for benchmarking advancement in registration methodologies, as well as for future research in managing the most common non-skin cancer in men.
The outcome of this challenge is the development of a method which produces an accurate alignment of the prostate gland and other anatomical structures, such as those provided as landmarks for localizing relevant anatomical and potentially pathological targets during guided prostate biopsies, and for treatment/intervention planning or decision support.
The challenge event will take place before lunch (12:30 - 12:50) during the ASMUS workshop.
